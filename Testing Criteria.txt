This document is updated for SPRINT ONE and will be applicable during that phase of development.
The nature of this application calls for a lot of manual testing, the program is written with JavaFX and uses scenes and nodes for most interaction, which aren't easily unit testable, so here is the manual testing criteria.
For the application to be considered tested, each of the following steps should be taken and verified:

MAIN MENU:
	When "Start Game" is pressed, the scene should transition into the player select screen, offering a 'One Player' or 'Two Player' Option, the console will also output that the button was pressed
	When 'Options' is pressed, the console will output that the button was pressed (functionality will be added in a later sprint)
	When 'Exit' is pressed, the application will close, and the console will output that the button was pressed

PLAYER SELECT:
	When "One Player" is pressed, the scene will transition into a game state with one controllable character, the console will also output that the button was pressed
	When "Two Player" is pressed, the scene will transition into a game state with one controllable character, the console will also output that the button was pressed

IN GAME:
	MOVEMENT:	
		When player one presses 'W' the player should move in a smooth motion in the north direction
		When player one presses 'S' the player should move in a smooth motion in the south direction
		When player one presses 'A' the player should move in a smooth motion in the west direction
		When player one presses 'D' the player should move in a smooth motion in the east direction
		When player one presses 'SHIFT' the player's movement speed should increase
		When player two presses 'UP' the player should move in a smooth motion in the north direction
		When player two presses 'DOWN' the player should move in a smooth motion in the south direction
		When player two presses 'LEFT' the player should move in a smooth motion in the west direction
		When player two presses 'RIGHT' the player should move in a smooth motion in the east direction
		When player two presses 'CONTROL' the player's movement speed should increase
		
		BOTH PLAYERS NEED TO BE TESTED TO INSURE THEY MOVE AT THE SAME SPEEDS WITH AND WITHOUT THE SPRINT KEY PRESSED

	COLLISION:
		When either player approaches the borders of the screen, the player should stop movement
		When either player collides with eachother, they should not be allowed to move freely through the other, and a message will print to the console stating that collision is enabled or disabled

	PAUSE:
		When the 'ESCAPE' key is pressed, the player characters should not be allowed to move, and a notification should appear with text prompting the user if they want to return to the main menu
		When the player presses 'OK' in the notification, they should be returned to the main menu. ALL MENU FUNCTIONALITY SHOULD BE RETESTED AFTER THIS TEST
		When the player presses 'CANCEL' in the notification, they should be able to resume control of their characters ALL IN GAME FUNCTIONALITY SHOULD BE RETESTED AFTER THIS TEST
